### Description

__Math 203__ covers topics of Intermediate Algebra such as the properties of real 
numbers and their operations; solutions and graphs of linear functions in one and 
two variables; absolute value equations; advanced factoring; complex numbers; 
systems of equations and inequalities; polynomials and exponents; rational 
expressions; rational exponents and radical; quadratic equations and inequalities; 
functions and relations; exponential and logarithmic functions; sequences and series.


### <a name="hw-policy"></a>Homework Assignments

- Weekly homework assignments are due as posted online.
- Assignments must be turned in during lecture.
- Don't wait until the last hour to do an assignment. Plan ahead and pace yourself.
- After the due date of each assignment, you will have access to the correct answers.
- You get credit for a homework assignment only if you complete all the questions.
- There are NO make-up or late HWs, for any reason, including, but not limited to, theft, extraordinary circumnstances, and your pet's dietary idiosyncrasies.
- Instead of late HW, I will drop two HW assignments at the end of the semester.
- You'll get extra credit if you turn in ALL assignments.
- If you need to turn in HW but can't come to class, I encourage to ask for help
from another student.
- I encourage you to collaborate with each other on the HW assignments. Still,
you must write up your our solutions.
- Each HW will be graded according to completeness: you get credit for 70% or more
of the problems done; no credit for less than 70% of problems done.
- Show your work on the problems, as appropriate. If answers are simply copied 
down, then they will not be counted.




### Grading Structure

Your course grade is based on homework, in-class participation, midterm exams, and a final exam. The percentage breakdown for each component is as follows:

- 5% attendance
- 15% homework
- 60% midterms
- 20% final

The final letter-grade scale is:

- A: 90%-100%
- B: 80%-89%
- C: 70%-79%
- D: 60%-69%
- F: below 60%


### Exams

- Midterm exams will include material and examples presented in lecture, examples from the textbook, and the exercises you are assigned in homework and for practice.
- Midterm exams are worth 60% of your course grade.
- The Final Exam will be a comprehensive exam, covering all topics presented in the course. It is worth 20% of your course grade. T​he Final Exam will take place on the Monday of Final Exam week during class time.
- Absolutely no make-up exams will be given.
- You are allowed to use a n​on-graphing​ scientific calculator during each exam. Other electronic devices such as smart phones, mobile devices, laptops, and tablets are NOT permitted during exams.
- _Please keep all of your exams._ ​This work is the only evidence outside of attending class of your efforts to succeed in the course.


### <a name="attendance-policy"></a> Attendance Policy

- Your attendance is an important part of your success in this course. Students who regularly miss class may therefore lose participation percentage points.
- You are entitled to 3 non-consecutive absences without downgrading your participation.
- If you never miss lecture, you'll get extra-credit.
- Students who miss more than 20% of classes will lose all participation points.
- You may be dropped if you are absent for more than one consecutive week of class without contacting me to explain your absences.
- If you are not present when I call roll, you will get an absence.
- Those who perform poorly on an exam, then fail to take the next one, w​ill​ be dropped.
- While attending class, please help to maintain a decent learning environment.
- No laptops, tablets, cell phones, or other similar electronic devices are allowed during lecture. 
- Please be considerate of others; t​urn o​ff​ your cell phones and put them away.
- Sit close to the door if you must leave early. If you are late, please try to find a seat as quickly and quietly as possible.



### <a name="email-policy"></a>Email Policy

- You should only use email as a tool to set up a one-on-one meeting with me if Office hours conflict with your schedule.
- Use the subject line __Meeting Request__.
- Your message should include at least two times when you would like to meet and a brief (one-two sentence) description of the reason for the meeting.
- Email sent for any other reason will NOT be considered or acknowledge.
- If you have an emergency, talk to me later during class or office hours.
- I strongly encourage you to ask questions about the syllabus, covered material, and assignments during class time or lab discussions. 
- Our conversations should take place in person rather than via email, thus allowing us to get to know each other better and fostering a more collegial learning atmosphere.


### Cheating Policy

Do your own work. Collaborating on homework is fine—but copying is not, nor 
is having somebody else submit assignments for you. Cheating will not be 
tolerated. Anyone found cheating will receive an F and will be reported to 
the Chair of the Department and the Dean.


### Student Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will:

- Have advanced use and understanding of formulas, equations, inequalities, 
graphs, and tables in making arguments about real world problems.
- Understand and use fundamental algebraic laws, concepts, techniques, symbols, 
terms, expressions, and equations to formulate and solve problems including 
quantitative problems arising in science and engineering.
- Learn to operate with (manipulate) various algebraic functions.


### Justification for the Course

Satisfies the general education mathematics requirement (area 4b) for the 
associate degree. Prepares students for subsequent courses in mathematics; 
i.e., Statistics and Trigonometry. Prepares students for
courses in other disciplines; i.e., Introduction to Computer Science.
